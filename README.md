# AFL Sports Analytics Agent

> A production-ready AFL analytics agent demonstrating agentic AI capabilities through a clean chat interface with Hex-quality visualizations.

## Overview

This project showcases an AI agent that autonomously analyzes Australian Football League (AFL) statistics, performs multi-step reasoning, and provides insights through natural language conversation with embedded interactive visualizations.

**Tech Stack**: Flask (backend) + React (frontend) + LangGraph (agent framework) + GPT-4o-mini + Supabase (PostgreSQL) + Plotly (visualizations)

## Features

- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English about AFL statistics
- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Agent autonomously plans and executes complex analyses
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Hex-quality Plotly charts embedded in chat
- **Real-time Streaming**: See the agent's thinking process as it works
- **35 Years of Data**: Complete AFL match statistics from 1990-2025 (6,243 matches)

### Example Queries

**Note**: Currently only match-level data is available. Player statistics pending ingestion.

```
"Who won the 2025 grand final?"
"Show me Richmond's win-loss record in 2022"
"Which teams had the most wins in 2023?"
"Show me Collingwood's scoring trend across 2024"
```

## Architecture

The agent uses **LangGraph** to orchestrate a multi-step workflow:

```
1. UNDERSTAND → Parse user intent and extract entities
2. PLAN → Determine analysis steps
3. EXECUTE → Run SQL queries and calculate statistics
4. VISUALIZE → Generate Plotly chart specifications
5. RESPOND → Format natural language summary
```

**Key Design Principles**:
- No code visible to users (SQL, Python, or errors)
- Streaming status updates ("Analyzing player statistics...")
- Hex-quality chart styling with Plotly
- Graceful degradation for complex queries

## Database Schema

Core tables:
- `teams` - AFL teams (18 teams)
- `players` - Player metadata
- `matches` - Match results (1990-2025)
- `player_stats` - Per-match player statistics
- `team_stats` - Per-match team statistics
- `conversations` - Agent conversation history

## Roadmap

### ✅ Completed
- ✅ Historical data (1990-2025, 6,243 matches)
- ✅ LangGraph agent workflow (UNDERSTAND → PLAN → EXECUTE → VISUALIZE → RESPOND)
- ✅ GPT-4o-mini text-to-SQL generation
- ✅ SQL validation and security
- ✅ Plotly visualization generator with Hex-quality theme
- ✅ Flask API with WebSocket support
- ✅ React frontend with real-time chat
- ✅ Chart rendering with react-plotly.js

### Phase 2 (Future Enhancements)
- [ ] Player statistics ingestion (~13,000 players)
- [ ] Advanced analytics (expected stats, form analysis)
- [ ] Streaming "thinking" updates through LangGraph workflow
- [ ] Conversation history and memory
- [ ] Chart export (download as PNG/SVG)
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Production deployment (Docker, hosting)
