"""
AFL Analytics Agent - Fast-Path Router

Intercepts simple, common queries BEFORE the full LangGraph pipeline.
Uses regex pattern matching + parameterized SQL templates + string response templates.
Zero LLM calls for matched queries — reduces latency from ~3-5s to ~100-300ms.

Falls through (returns None) for:
- Queries that don't match any pattern
- Follow-up queries ("what about 2023?")
- Entity resolution failures (unknown team/player)
- DB returning 0 rows
